## Introduction

This is one of practice project of Udacity Front-End Nano degree course.

All core functions are coded in the file `designs.js`. The most inspired lesson-learned to me in this project is to practice coding skill every day, otherwise I could not remember the basic JS syntax which is absolutely a shame on me!

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to Play

Follow steps on the webpage, start to draw the canvas with a chosen color. Have fun!
